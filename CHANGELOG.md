# v0.3 (2014-07-04)

* The module cache is cleared of files matching the specified extension at the end of each render. This allows views to be modified without restarting the server.

# v0.2 (2014-04-05)

* `__express` and `renderFile` are gone. You must now call `createEngine(options)` which will create an engine with given options.


# v0.1 (2014-03-31)
